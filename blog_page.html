      <h2>The vanishing of Will Byers</h2>
      <h3>November 6th, 1983, Hawkins, Indiana</h3>
      <p>Riding in the dark past the laboratory, the light on Will's bike briefly flickers out. When it comes back on, a tall, faceless figure appears before him. Will swerves off the road and crashes his bike in the woods. He then runs home as the figure pursues him. He finds his house empty. Will dials 9-1-1 but only hears garbled static on the phone. He sees a dark shadow moving on his front porch. His locked front door seemingly opens by itself from the inside, causing Will to flee to a backyard shed. He grabs a rifle inside and loads it, aiming it at the door as the lights above him flicker. The figure rises up behind him and Will turns to face it, the lights brightening before going back to normal, both Will and the figure now gone.</p>
